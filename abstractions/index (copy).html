                    Hi, I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakshyapriyadarshi/" target="_blank" >Lakshya</a>! I am a researcher at a deep-tech startup in India. I use this blog as a medium for writing about interesting ideas in ML/AI, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/what-is-quantum-computing/" target="_blank"> quantum computing</a>, and CS research in general. My aim through this blog is to get undergrad students in computing and information technologies <b>excited</b> about the field and motivate them to explore its depth and breadth. The core idea is to create a learning ecosystem in which research is viewed as a fundamental aspect of science-tech education. <br><br>



                    This blog will be particularly useful to students that are interested in industry R&D or in graduate studies. Even if you're an absolute novice and need resources to build up, this blog is a nice place to start. Let's learn together!<br><br>

                    

                    To learn more about the philosophy of this blog, please read Why "I created abstractions?". If there is any way I could help you, please get in touch.

                  <p>From ideas to algorithms to machines to languages, and from theory to systems to applications, computing is a phenomenal feat. I've tried to create a set of learning resources that students can refer to during their courses, beyond-the-course learning, and as the first steps into research. Simply put, it's a rigorous companion to your undergrad CS explorations that opens up a window to the vast expanse of computing and information.
